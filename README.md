**GraminRoute** is a Next-Gen logistics platform optimized for the unique challenges of **Rural Indian Retail**.

It moves beyond traditional "Shortest Path" algorithms by integrating a **Hybrid Quantum-Graph Neural Network (Q-GNN)**. This AI predicts demand surges and stockout risks before they happen, allowing distributors to proactively **Pool Orders** and maximize efficiency in "Last-Mile" delivery.

## 🧠 The "Brain": Hybrid Quantum-GNN Architecture

The core intelligence of this system resides in `model_def.py`. Unlike standard regression models, our architecture treats the district as a **Graph Network** where every village is a node connected by road edges.

### **1. The Quantum Layer (VQC)**
* **Technology:** [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) + PyTorch.
* **Structure:** A **7-Qubit Variational Quantum Circuit**.
* **Why Quantum?** Rural data is noisy and sparse. By embedding the 7 input features (Stock, Sales, Shelf Life, etc.) into a high-dimensional quantum Hilbert space, the model captures non-linear correlations—such as the subtle relationship between "Upcoming Festivals" and "Perishable Inventory Burn Rate"—that classical models often overlook.

### **2. The Graph Layer (GNN)**
* **Technology:** [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/).
* **Algorithm:** **Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2)**.
* **Function:** It aggregates data from neighboring villages. If Village A sees a demand spike, the GNN infers that neighboring Village B (connected by a road edge) is likely to see one too, enabling "Spatial Awareness."

## 🚀 Key Features

### **Backend (The Intelligence)**
* **⚠️ Predictive Risk Engine:** The AI calculates a **Risk Score (0-100%)** for every shop. High risk triggers "Anti-Burn" alerts; high demand triggers "Profit Capture" bulk buy recommendations.
* **📦 Cooperative Order Pooling:** Uses **Spatial Clustering (Haversine Distance)** to group small orders from nearby villages (< 3km radius). This converts 5 small deliveries into 1 bulk "Milk Run," unlocking **Wholesale Discounts (15%+)**.
* **🛒 Intelligent Distributor Recommender:** A dynamic ranking system that prioritizes **Speed** (during high-risk stockouts) or **Cost** (during routine restocks) based on the AI's risk assessment.

### **Frontend (The Visualization)**
* **⚡ High-Performance Dashboard:** Built with **React + Vite**, utilizing **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for instant updates.
* **🗺️ Geospatial Map:** An interactive dashboard that visualizes the entire district.
    * **Red Zones:** Critical risk shops requiring immediate delivery.
    * **Blue Routes:** Optimized "Milk Run" paths generated by the Pooling Engine.
* **📱 Retailer App:** A mobile-first interface for shopkeepers to view stock alerts, approve bulk orders, and join neighborhood pools.
